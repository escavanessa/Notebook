# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


<h1>THE GOAL</h1>
I have always wnated to make a sort of notebook/ productivity tracker. I feel like there are some core function in a notebook type app that are essential to understand like CRUD and saving onto the local device. I wanted the user to be able to make sticky notes, have a checklist with the basic functions like adding and deleting. I also want the user to be able to 'add' notebooks and add notes into the notebooks. Generally i would like for the app to be really customizable but we will see how far I get.

<h1>THE PROCESS</h1>
i started with the check list. Probably the most basic thing you can add. i went in with the adding and deleting functionality id just like to add the ability to edit what you wrote maybe by a double click. i then went in with the sticky notes which is sort of 'the main event.' this was interesting to make because i wanted each note to randomly generate a different background color. For a moment, every letter i typed into the input would change the background color of all the stickies - resulting in a disco party. I fixed it but what an interesting side effect. 

<h1>WHAT I LEARNED</h1>
im learning more avout CRUD which i feel is absolutely essential. I woudl really like to deepen this app by adding Node js. I am very new to venturing out past front end but id really like to try my hand at digging into the back end a bit to actually integrate CRUD.
